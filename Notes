Sept 28:
Critical temperature seems to be limit of correlation between simulated and empirical functional connectivity

Values near the critical temperature give the closest results to the empirical FC

The critical temperature can be estimated by plotting the standard deviation of the cumulative average energy per
temperature

Past the critical temperature, the ising model becomes chaotic with a total spin of 0. FC becomes unusable

It is important to choose the number of steps for the metropolis algorithm carefully when using temperatures near the
critical temperature, as the algorithm becomes chaotic only after a certain amount of steps

The longer the algorithm spends in chaos, the more distorted the simulated FC becomes. Empirical data suggests that the
FC spends a little bit of time in the "chaotic region" based on the distinct grid pattern
